not to be the 1st person to die in a horror movie but I don’t 100% believe in ghosts and even if they were real I’m much more afraid of capitalism so I’m considering buying a haunted house in the future if that means it’s at a very reduced cost and it’s gonna take way more than doors suddenly closing to change my mind]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing PathQuery, Google's Graph Query Language
We introduce PathQuery, a graph query language developed to scale with Google's query and data volumes as well as its internal developer community. PathQuery supports flexible and declarative semantics. We have found that this enables query developers to think in a naturally "graphy" design space and to avoid the additional cognitive effort of coordinating numerous joins and subqueries often required to express an equivalent query in a relational space. Despite its traversal-oriented syntactic style, PathQuery has a foundation on a custom variant of relational algebra -- the exposition of which we presently defer -- allowing for the application of both common and novel optimizations. We believe that PathQuery has withstood a "test of time" at Google, under both large scale and low latency requirements. We thus share herein a language design that admits a rigorous declarative semantics, has scaled well in practice, and provides a natural syntax for graph traversals while also admitting complex graph patterns.

Things that are somewhat interesting to me, from an engineering standpoint:
1. PathQuery has a module/compilation system, enabling re-use of PathQuery modules across projects.  (Someone had mentioned that Google has around 40,000 PathQuery modules already, internally...)
Also, from a socio-linguistic perspective, Graph Languages are effectively the new Object-Relational Mapping layer, but they solve an interesting organizational problem of allowing multiple teams to code in different languages, without needing to re-write / re-implement entities and mapping configurations in each language.  It's the Old New Thing again...]]></summary>

Somewhere in my notes in the last few days I saw someone add some tags that I’ve been thinking about ever since. I wish I could find them again (or that I’d just saved their post at the time) because I think they made a lot of sense. 
They were talking about how fanfic is becoming more and more mainstream while still remaining largely transgressive. It’s such an interesting dichotomy to think about!
On the one hand, you have sites like AO3 and realities like widespread high speed internet access being more and more accessible to larger and larger groups of people. This makes it incredibly easy for anyone at all to find and read fanfic. 
On the other hand, you have the roots of fanfic. It was b…]]></summary>

A lot of people ask me what my biggest fear is, or what scares me most. And I know they expect an answer like heights, or closed spaces, or people dressed like animals, but how do I tell them that when I was 17 I took a class called Relationships For Life and I learned that most people fall out of love for the same reasons they fell in it. That their lover’s once endearing stubbornness has now become refusal to compromise and their one track mind is now immaturity and their bad habits that you once adored is now money down the drain. Their spontaneity becomes reckless and irresponsible and their feet up on your dash is no longer sexy, just another distraction in your busy life.

It uses magnetic devices with unique custom-manufactured locking bolts. It allows the wearer to open their mouths only about 2mm, restricting them to a liquid diet, but it allows free speech and doesn't restrict breathing. [...] The practice of surgically wiring people's jaws shut became popular in the 1980s, but it came with risks; vomiting brought with it the risk of choking and after 9 to 12 months the patients developed gum disease. In some cases, there were continuing issues with restriction of jaw movement and some developed acute psychiatric conditions. [...] "The beauty of it is that once patients are fitted with the device, after two or three weeks they can have the magnets disengaged. They could then have a period with a less restricted diet and then go back into treatment," he says. [...] Patients are given a tool to open the device in an emergency, but none of the study participants needed to use it. Can't wait until these get 0wnz0red like the internet dick cage.]]></summary>

The new creatures tab also covers the animals section of the old 'z' status screens, and the main unit list also has a stress readout so you can easily figure out who is having trouble.

SSI Restoration Act of 2021
i have never made a post like this before but i haven’t seen anyone here talk about it yet so i want to at least provide some links because this is extremely important for disabled people with or without benefits in the USA.

link to this tiktok 


she doesn’t name the bill in the video but in the comments it’s clarified that the act referred to is the SSI Restoration Act of 2021.
“The Supplementary Security Income (SSI) Restoration Act of 2021 has been introduced in both the House and the Senate. The bill would improve the lives of millions of SSI beneficiaries around the country, including over 2 million older adults who are living below the federal poverty level due to inadequate benefit levels, and often lose or are denied benefits due to outdated…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our opening weekend was amazing! All of the events were really fun, and packed. It's nice to be back. The thing that struck me most about our Friday night re-opening party, Turbo Drive, was that it wasn't the usual Turbo Drive crowd. I got the impression that a lot of people said to themselves, "I don't know what synthwave is, but I'm going anyway." And they stuck around, too! Also they all dressed up, but everyone dressed up for a different party. Here's a girl dressed for the symphony, here's a guy dressed for a punk show in 1977, here's Lara Croft swing dancing with Snake Plissken. I very much hope that this wasn't a one-off and that people hold on to that attitude: "I don't know what this is, but let's check it out anyway". Nature is healing and you are allowed to try new things. Then Saturday, we had three events: the early show was Hubba Hubba Revue, followed by Bootie in the main room and Lower Underground in Above DNA. The audiences for these parties were more traditional; it was the usual Hubba, Bootie and dubstep/rave crowds, but, there were nearly twice as many of them as in the Before Times, which was awesome. I had wondered whether people would stil be skittish about being in crowds, and the answer to that is, NOPE. They were happy being absolutely packed in, sweating all over each other. Though all our staff are still wearing masks, I'd say that less than 1% of the customers were. No soft re-entry here: they have embraced the Full Florida. I also very much expected to see some people getting seriously sloppy by about 1am, since everyone is out of practice at drinking in public, but nope again: they mostly held their shit together pretty well! Good form, SF. Our crew were all pretty exhausted by the end. It's going to take a little while to get our sea legs back. And also we are still hiring -- bartenders, security, restaurant and floor.

		the last Steam News, concerning beekeeping
	
, from earlier this month.


Since then, I've mostly been working on the trade screen.  It's basically at a good spot now, though there are various bits that could be added, probably most notably the ability to view items again (it's not compatible with how we have our item sheets set up now, but I can work through it), and a few new lines of text to make the hidden haggling mechanics a little more sensible (to new players, counter-offers feel like they trigger at random, but it's actually based on skill rolls vs. profit/mood, etc.)  Also notably, there are item string filters now.  The little merchant in the top left is so low because creatures can be 64 pixels tall now, and dwarves can even be taller than 32 pixels if they have the right hair style, I think, but I'll probably adjust the positioning for smaller creatures before the end.  These sorts of things add up to make each of these screen rewrites take longer than expected, but another one down brings us that much closer.


Next up we'll probably be looking at finishing the labor rewrite, the workshop profiles, and then how that all connects up e.g. to the military stuff (through e.g. civilian item assignments.)  That's also bound to get a little messy, ha ha.]]></summary>

Last year I put out a call for people who wanted to paint murals on some of our blank walls, but nothing really came of that, so last week I painted some chevrons on the balcony: I'd still like to get something painted on the walls inside the DNA Pizza and Above DNA restrooms, if only to cut down on the tagging.

love looks like the mosaic from ancient rome about a race horse that says: “win or lose, we love you, polidoxus”

love looks like all the people across history who have cared for their pets and named them sweet things like much-beloved or lovely or precious or grain-of-gold. and commissioned for their likenesses to be carved or painted or made into mosaics. bc their affection was so much greater and grander than the constraints of a human lifetime. and some piece of those pets outlasted even their owners in the annals of history. like that’s love]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always enjoy it when people tell on themselves with their font changes, making it clear that they have sent a hastily-edited form letter rather than a sincere one-to-one communication. Here's what a recent email looked like when viewed in Mail on iOS: And here's what it looked like in Mail on macOS. The difference is more subtle, but the text of [MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA] is still smaller (capital letters are 25px instead of 28px). Also one of them is Arial and the other is Helvetica. Now, I know what you're thinking -- normally when someone makes that distinction you know that you're dealing with some kind of font-hipster super-nerd. This is true. But when they're side by side, sometimes even normal people can tell them apart! Here's an easy way to screw up like this on macOS: Compose an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XScreenSaver 6.01 is out now. This is an X11-only maintenance release, so there are no macOS, iOS or Android packages this time around. The 6.00 refactor of the X11 XScreenSaver daemon has so far proven to be very stable and secure! The bugs fixed in this release are relatively minor. However: If you are using 6.00, I strongly recommend upgrading to 6.01. If you are using 5.xx, I strongly, strongly recommend upgrading to 6.01. Sadly, due to recent catastrophic decision-making on the part of certain Linux distros, I was forced to add the following section to the XScreenSaver manual: THE WAYLAND PROBLEM Wayland is a completely different window system that is intended to replace X11. After 13+ years of trying, some Linux distros have finally begun enabling it by default. Most deployments of it also include XWayland, which is a compatibility layer that allows some X11 programs to continue to work within a Wayland environment. Unfortunately, XScreenSaver is not one of those programs. If your system is running XWayland, XScreenSaver will malfunction in two ways: It will be unable to detect user activity in non-X11 programs. This means that while a native Wayland program is selected, XScreenSaver will think that you are idle, and may blank the screen prematurely. It will be unable to lock the screen. This is because X11 grabs don't work properly under XWayland, so there is no way for XScreenSaver to prevent the user from switching away from the screen locker to another application. If you are aware of some way for XScreenSaver to reliably detect user activity under Wayland, do let me know. Maybe there is some dbus/systemd signal that I have missed? Now that the XScreenSaver 6.x daemon has been sandboxed and massively reduced in size, it might be plausible for someone to rewrite xscreensaver.c to speak Wayland instead of X11, to run inside the Wayland compositor, and then to launch the X11 programs xscreensaver-auth and xscreensaver-gfx as needed. But that someone will not be me.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[cheeseanonioncrisps:

Fact 1: ‘Rubber duck debugging’ is a programming technique whereby a programmer explains their code, line by line, to a rubber duck. The idea is that in explaining it they will eventually figure out what the problem is.
Fact 2: In the same way, a lot of ordinary non-programming problems can be solved by talking them over with a friend, even if said friend does not actually know that much about the topic/situation and can’t contribute much to the conversation.
Fact 3: When you thank said friend for helping you solve your problem, and they reply “I didn’t really say anything”, it is very inadvisable to take the opportunity to tell them about Fact 1. No matter how interesting a comparison it may seem at the time.]]></summary>

by Peter H. Hochschild, Paul Turner, Jeffrey C. Mogul,
Rama Govindaraju, Parthasarathy Ranganathan, David E. Culler, and Amin Vahdat.
“As fabrication pushes towards smaller feature sizes and more
elaborate computational structures, and as increasingly specialized
instruction-silicon pairings are introduced to improve performance, we
have observed ephemeral computational errors that were not detected
during manufacturing tests. These defects cannot always be mitigated
by techniques such as microcode updates, and may be correlated to
specific components within the processor, allowing small code changes
to effect large shifts in reliability. Worse, these failures are often
“silent” – the only symptom is an erroneous computation.”

We recently got a screaming deal on this gargantuan 75" TV, so we turned it into an instagram trap under the main stairs. I think it's going to be very popular! "What software does it use?" None, it uses none software. Video feedback works better if it stays in the analog domain, as with 30+ year old camcorders and CRTs rather than that four letter word "HDMI", but one does what one can. Hey, here's an interior decoration project maybe one of you could help us out with. The Green Room, that room to the South of the Lounge that you enter from the stage-left stairs, has always been less inviting than we'd like. People treat it as more of a hallway than as a place to hang out. I think it could use a bunch of overstuffed thrift-shop couches and chairs -- really gaudy stuff -- and also a shitload of chandeliers. It has a surprisingly high ceiling, and I think that filling that space with dozens of chandeliers might look pretty cool. So, if you are a person who already has the hobby of frequenting thrift shops and estate sales, I'd love to give you a small monthly budget for broken down chandeliers and couches to dress up that room. (The couches, I assume, won't long survive contact with the enemy and will need to be periodically replenished.)]]></summary>

You shouldn’t be treating nb people like the secret sexy 3rd gender. Nb people don’t look like a mash of male and female, they’re not sexy androgynous twinks

white skinny androgynous nb people reblogging this and saying shit like “Well this is what I look like! So I feel represented!” Are literally part of the problem. I’m not saying that no nb people are white/skinny/andro, I’m saying that those are the only type of nb bodies that get represented 


its nice, isnt it, when nonbinary people are visibly distinct from binary people? its easy, isnt it? you can remember to use “they” for people who have no visible breasts or beards, right? no need to challenge the notion of male vs female if nonbinary people have their own look, isnt that right?
its time to step the fuck up and really understand that nonbinary looks like anybody. nonbinary looks like you. nonbinary looks like your family and friends and it looks like the strangers who you thoughtlessly call “he” or “she” because of their appearance.
really supporting nonbinary people means understanding that theres no visual tell - you wont recognise all of us as nonbinary on sight. you have to actually LISTEN to us. you have to BELIEVE us. and it means challenging your assumptions about gender, starting with the assumption that youre an ally to trans people while youre still doing puerile shit like gendering body parts and clothes.
NONBINARY LOOKS LIKE ANYBODY. ANY BODY CAN BE NONBINARY.]]></summary>

Thematically speaking, the most important thing Terry Pratchett taught me was the concept of militant decency. The idea that you can look at the world and its flaws and its injustices and its cruelties and get deeply, intensely angry, and that you can turn that into energy for doing the right thing and making the world a better place. He taught me that the anger itself is not the part I should be fighting. Nobody in my life ever said that before.]]></summary>

shoutout to everybody who cannot partake in the shared history spongebob memes give everyone because they were, for some inexplicable reason, never allowed to watch spongebob 

It’s weird because unlike most other experiences, this is not one you can go back and rectify. It’s already too late for me to grow up watching spongebob  

Few things in this world can be genuinely lost forever and I don’t know how to feel that this, of all things, is one of them 



I disliked Spongebob as a kid and decided on my own not to watch it. It kept preempting ATLA.]]></summary>
