        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XScreenSaver 6.01 is out now. This is an X11-only maintenance release, so there are no macOS, iOS or Android packages this time around. The 6.00 refactor of the X11 XScreenSaver daemon has so far proven to be very stable and secure! The bugs fixed in this release are relatively minor. However: If you are using 6.00, I strongly recommend upgrading to 6.01. If you are using 5.xx, I strongly, strongly recommend upgrading to 6.01. Sadly, due to recent catastrophic decision-making on the part of certain Linux distros, I was forced to add the following section to the XScreenSaver manual: THE WAYLAND PROBLEM Wayland is a completely different window system that is intended to replace X11. After 13+ years of trying, some Linux distros have finally begun enabling it by default. Most deployments of it also include XWayland, which is a compatibility layer that allows some X11 programs to continue to work within a Wayland environment. Unfortunately, XScreenSaver is not one of those programs. If your system is running XWayland, XScreenSaver will malfunction in two ways: It will be unable to detect user activity in non-X11 programs. This means that while a native Wayland program is selected, XScreenSaver will think that you are idle, and may blank the screen prematurely. It will be unable to lock the screen. This is because X11 grabs don't work properly under XWayland, so there is no way for XScreenSaver to prevent the user from switching away from the screen locker to another application. If you are aware of some way for XScreenSaver to reliably detect user activity under Wayland, do let me know. Maybe there is some dbus/systemd signal that I have missed? Now that the XScreenSaver 6.x daemon has been sandboxed and massively reduced in size, it might be plausible for someone to rewrite xscreensaver.c to speak Wayland instead of X11, to run inside the Wayland compositor, and then to launch the X11 programs xscreensaver-auth and xscreensaver-gfx as needed. But that someone will not be me.]]></summary>

i dont know why people are like ‘we need to bully people so they are more normal’ when if the internet has been anything its been a series of longitudinal studies showing that prolonged large scale bullying tends to lead people to becoming increasingly weird, paranoid, sometimes off-putting, traumatized, emotionally troubled, ethically disregulated, etc. even unethical modalities like behaviorism don’t focus exclusively or primarily on punishment. like people should literally just be honest and say they want more bullying because they like to do it and have fun hurting other people]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[cheeseanonioncrisps:

Fact 1: ‘Rubber duck debugging’ is a programming technique whereby a programmer explains their code, line by line, to a rubber duck. The idea is that in explaining it they will eventually figure out what the problem is.
Fact 2: In the same way, a lot of ordinary non-programming problems can be solved by talking them over with a friend, even if said friend does not actually know that much about the topic/situation and can’t contribute much to the conversation.
Fact 3: When you thank said friend for helping you solve your problem, and they reply “I didn’t really say anything”, it is very inadvisable to take the opportunity to tell them about Fact 1. No matter how interesting a comparison it may seem at the time.]]></summary>

by Peter H. Hochschild, Paul Turner, Jeffrey C. Mogul,
Rama Govindaraju, Parthasarathy Ranganathan, David E. Culler, and Amin Vahdat.
“As fabrication pushes towards smaller feature sizes and more
elaborate computational structures, and as increasingly specialized
instruction-silicon pairings are introduced to improve performance, we
have observed ephemeral computational errors that were not detected
during manufacturing tests. These defects cannot always be mitigated
by techniques such as microcode updates, and may be correlated to
specific components within the processor, allowing small code changes
to effect large shifts in reliability. Worse, these failures are often
“silent” – the only symptom is an erroneous computation.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of life's simple joys is pointing a video camera at a TV. We should all do that more often. We recently got a screaming deal on this gargantuan 75" TV, so we turned it into an instagram trap under the main stairs. I think it's going to be very popular! "What software does it use?" None, it uses none software. Video feedback works better if it stays in the analog domain, as with 30+ year old camcorders and CRTs rather than that four letter word "HDMI", but one does what one can. Hey, here's an interior decoration project maybe one of you could help us out with. The Green Room, that room to the South of the Lounge that you enter from the stage-left stairs, has always been less inviting than we'd like. People treat it as more of a hallway than as a place to hang out. I think it could use a bunch of overstuffed thrift-shop couches and chairs -- really gaudy stuff -- and also a shitload of chandeliers. It has a surprisingly high ceiling, and I think that filling that space with dozens of chandeliers might look pretty cool. So, if you are a person who already has the hobby of frequenting thrift shops and estate sales, I'd love to give you a small monthly budget for broken down chandeliers and couches to dress up that room. (The couches, I assume, won't long survive contact with the enemy and will need to be periodically replenished.)]]></summary>

You shouldn’t be treating nb people like the secret sexy 3rd gender. Nb people don’t look like a mash of male and female, they’re not sexy androgynous twinks

white skinny androgynous nb people reblogging this and saying shit like “Well this is what I look like! So I feel represented!” Are literally part of the problem. I’m not saying that no nb people are white/skinny/andro, I’m saying that those are the only type of nb bodies that get represented 


its nice, isnt it, when nonbinary people are visibly distinct from binary people? its easy, isnt it? you can remember to use “they” for people who have no visible breasts or beards, right? no need to challenge the notion of male vs female if nonbinary people have their own look, isnt that right?
its time to step the fuck up and really understand that nonbinary looks like anybody. nonbinary looks like you. nonbinary looks like your family and friends and it looks like the strangers who you thoughtlessly call “he” or “she” because of their appearance.
really supporting nonbinary people means understanding that theres no visual tell - you wont recognise all of us as nonbinary on sight. you have to actually LISTEN to us. you have to BELIEVE us. and it means challenging your assumptions about gender, starting with the assumption that youre an ally to trans people while youre still doing puerile shit like gendering body parts and clothes.
NONBINARY LOOKS LIKE ANYBODY. ANY BODY CAN BE NONBINARY.]]></summary>

Thematically speaking, the most important thing Terry Pratchett taught me was the concept of militant decency. The idea that you can look at the world and its flaws and its injustices and its cruelties and get deeply, intensely angry, and that you can turn that into energy for doing the right thing and making the world a better place. He taught me that the anger itself is not the part I should be fighting. Nobody in my life ever said that before.]]></summary>

It’s weird because unlike most other experiences, this is not one you can go back and rectify. It’s already too late for me to grow up watching spongebob  

Few things in this world can be genuinely lost forever and I don’t know how to feel that this, of all things, is one of them

Reblog if you would burn down the statue of liberty to save a life
Here’s the thing, though. If you asked a conservative “Would you let the statue of liberty burn to save one life?” they’d probably scoff and say no, it’s a national landmark, a treasure, a piece of too much historical importance to let it be destroyed for the sake of one measly life. 
But if you asked, “Would you let the statue of liberty burn in order to save your child? your spouse? someone you loved a great deal?” the tune abruptly changes. At…]]></summary>

something about needless tragedy when its effectively written and how it works SO well. boromir taking like seven arrows to the chest and continuing to fight and it doesnt save merry and pippin. the fact that merry and pippin were needlessly taken bc the uruks thought they had the ring, which they didnt. there are people in this war willingly sacrificing themselves to distract sauron from frodo and then there are people given no time to think through a plan, doing the best with the few seconds they have and dying with the hope that their actions will protect the people they love. and sometimes it doesnt. boromirs epic final stand did not actually matter, did not give the hobbits a chance to escape. but his final breaths were given with love nonetheless.

sometimes heroism is not in whether or not your actions actually save people, sometimes the glory is simply in the desperate and heartfelt trying]]></summary>

Is there any good software out there for that? Any other suggestions? It's very heavy, so using it as an on-stage prop would be a hassle; it needs to be mounted somewhere. We could just stick it in the DNA Pizza window and use it for signage, but that's not very exciting.]]></summary>

Because of course the perfectly functional iPads we already have are now unsuitable. These things would have been considered supercomputers in the 90s, but I'm to believe that they are so old and obsolete that they are incapable of keeping up with someone clicking the button that says "cheese slice". A task like that obviously requires the absolute bleeding edge. Apple has stopped shipping OS updates for our existing iPads, and vendors don't support old versions of iOS, largely because Apple intentionally makes it nearly impossible for them to do so even if they wanted to. The second worst part is that nobody offers data portability of any kind. If we …]]></summary>

why are lemons separate from food op?

everyone knows lemons arent food

lemon stealing whores are a huge issue separate from food stealing whores. there’s a whole documentary about whores stealing lemons from the trees of unsuspecting victims. you can see the first two minutes of it here.



Thats a rickroll. That totally is a fucking rickroll. No fukin way. Not falling for it.

dude, trust me, that isn’t a rick roll. its something worse



Me to the rest of tumblr after actually watching what was in the link:

…I really don’t know what I was expecting.



What the fuck did i just watch.



It- it’s not a Rick  roll 



Have we really reached a time when the Lemon Stealing Whores are no longer common knowledge.]]></summary>

No more burlesque performers complaining about getting splinters in their butts! We replaced the floor in our walk-in fridge. Ten years of dragging beer kegs over it took quite a toll: And we built a new VIP booth. We've replaced the two upstairs 6-person booths with a single 9-person booth.

It’s extremely weird how comfortable people are with violence if it wears a police uniform. Like someone who would be afraid to even raise their voice against a customer and would never dream of shoving someone in intimidation in any situation is somehow simultaneously okay with asking someone to go up and threaten them with a loaded gun and drag them out of the building. If cops weren’t normalized and it was just some random guy, they’d never do it. They wouldn’t turn to their coworker and say “that person’s breaking the store policy, can you take this loaded gun and chase him out of here?” I wish I could snap people out of this cognitive dissonance they have where violence doesn’t count if it comes with a badge.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-05-22T16:30:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Lazyweb, I've had a couple of people report that after upgrading to Fedora 34, XScreenSaver 6.00 has stopped being able to detect user activity and activates prematurely. From the logs they sent, it looks like the XInput2 extension still exists but has stopped working entirely. No events are printed by driver/test-xinput (with no args, or with -grab -kbd-async -mouse-async). Can anyone confirm or deny this? The server is still X.Org 12101001, however it was launched by sddm / startplasma / Xwayland and the environment contains XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland and WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0. So maybe it's Wayland that is screwing everything up? One user was using Gnome and one was using KDE. Maybe there's a way to configure the system to go back to running "real" X11 instead of whatever fresh hell of X11 / Wayland hybridization this is? Or is there some way for me to infect Raspbian 10.9 with this hybridization so that I can reproduce it myself? Related question: At some point in the distant past, I convinced myself that Wayland was incompatible with XScreenSaver locking, and therefore XScreenSaver refuses to lock when $WAYLAND_DISPLAY is set. I commented this change with "X11 grabs don't work under Wayland's embedded X11 server. The Wayland window manager lives at a higher level than the X11 emulation layer." However, now I can't find any record of what the actual problem was. Do you know? My guess is that it's something like running X11 under macOS: the grabs stay inside the X11 app, but you can still use Cmd-Tab to switch away to non-X11 apps even if X11 thinks things are "locked" inside its little sandbox. But I don't remember.]]></summary>

But it has also knocked me out for days, and I've still got insomnia and I physically tire quickly.  Hopefully that'll all pass before too long.  Still moving this month, and it's going to keep slowing everything down to a crawl.  The lease on the old place lapses this month, so we'll get through it one way or another!

Here is an archive of IGN's list of charities helping Palestinian civilians, before it was taken down.  The organizations listed are


Palestine Children's Relief Fund


Anera


United Nations Relief and Works Agency


Medical Aid for Palestinians


Doctors Without Borders


We oppose US-backed war crimes and the continuing apartheid, including the ongoing bombing in Gaza and evictions in Jerusalem and the West Bank.]]></summary>

Our lineup that evening begins with Hubba Hubba Revue at 7pm, the full, seated Big Show; then at 10pm, we bring you the triumphant return of Bootie Mashup! And in Above DNA, Xile Collective presents Lower Underground! Obviously the Feds or the State might pull the rug out from under us on this, but our understanding as of today is that in mid June, all restrictions will be lifted in California, and we get to party like it's 2019. Or, "The Full Florida", as I've been calling it. We are all incredibly excited to invite you back into our house, show you our lovely remodeling and upgrades, and return to something like normalcy -- after having been closed for (what will have been) fourteen months! I'm sure you have questions. I probably don't have answers. We're all still figuring this out. Tickets are on sale now. Oh yeah, and also we're hiring!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jeff Bezos' superyacht is so big it needs its own yacht. The world's richest man is buying a boat, though that word feels inappropriately sensible for the monstrosity going to Captain Bezos: a 417-foot superyacht that's so massive it has its own "support yacht" with a helipad. The estimated cost, not including the boat's support boat, is $500 million. Half a billion bucks is an inconceivable amount of money for most people, but it's a small fraction of the $75 billion that Bezos gained in 2020 alone. His total net worth stands just shy of $200 billion. Amazon stock rose a staggering 75% last year. [...] Recent quarters for superyachts have been record-breaking, one analyst told Bloomberg. Makers of extravagant yachts can barely keep up. "It's impossible to get a slot in a new-build yard," the analyst said. "They're totally booked."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a time-lapse video of the dance floor installation! This is the first two days of the floor installation. They also came back for a third full day of sanding, but that wasn't very interesting to watch; and now we're going to paint it, which will take another day or two. (We do have an older video where you can watch paint dry, if you're in to that sort of thing.) We set up a laptop recording 24/7 all weekend with OBS, and that generated a 98 GB TS file. Fun fact: guess what Quicktime Player, VLC and ffmpeg really don't like to deal with? That's right, 98 GB TS files. So my plan to just scrub through it and find the timestamps to extract didn't work because no player would let me scrub. I ended up splitting it into 10 minute segments with: -map 0 -f segment -segment_time 10 -reset_timestamps 1 $encode_options With "-codec copy" it wouldn't split at all, so I had to re-encode it. Then I was able to manually page through and delete the segments that were in the middle of the night. Next, I time-lapsed like this: -f concat -i file_list.txt -vf 'tblend=average, setpts=PTS*0.01, tmix=frames=30' -r 30 $encode_options The "tblend" filter is what gives the ghostly motion-blur effect on the people walking around. Without that, time lapses have a much more flickery, stuttery quality to them. That final encode took twenty hours to convert 22 hours of source video into a 13 minute time lapse on a 3.2 GHz iMac Pro. So this is maybe not the ideal procedure.]]></summary>
