                    <span>Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Github&quot; product now does auto-complete madlibs to write code for you. It&#x27;s a marketing stunt. It&#x27;s a gag. But it&#x27;s also a massive license-violation framework. Here is the correct take: Github Copilot has, by their own admission, been trained on mountains of GPL code, so i&#x27;m unclear on how it&#x27;s not a form of laundering open source code into commercial works. The handwave of &quot;it usually doesn&#x27;t reproduce exact chunks&quot; is not very satisfying. Copyright does not only cover copying and pasting; it covers derivative works. Github Copilot was trained on open source code and the sum total of everything it knows was drawn from that code. There is no possible interpretation of &quot;derivative&quot; that does not include this. I&#x27;m really tired of the tech industry treating neural networks like magic black boxes that spit out something completely novel, and taking free software for granted while paying out $150k salaries for writing ad delivery systems. The two have finally fused and it sucks. Previous &quot;AI&quot; generation has been trained on public text and photos, which are harder to make copyright claims on, but this is drawn from large bodies of work with very explicit court-tested licenses, so I look forward to the inevitable massive class action suits over this. &quot;But eevee, humans also learn by reading open source code, so isn&#x27;t that the same thing&quot; No. Humans are capable of abstract understanding and have a breadth of other knowledge to draw from. Statistical models do not. You have fallen for marketing Even MIT code still requires attribution, and they don&#x27;t even know who to attribute the output to.</span>

                    <span>Upside, at least the taxpayers whose homes LAPD destroyed are going to get to buy the cops a fancy new truck! 17 Injured After Planned Detonation Of Seized Illegal Fireworks Ends In Explosion: The explosion occurred after the LAPD had seized over 5,000 pounds of illegal fireworks from a nearby home. Ten pounds of the illegal fireworks were placed in a specialized armored truck designed for controlled detonations. The explosion flipped cars and shattered windows across a two-block radius. There&#x27;s no word on exactly how many homes were damaged. About 12 homes are under mandatory evacuation. I also like how before LAPD blew up a neighborhood they were &quot;fireworks&quot; but afterward they were &quot;improvised explosive devices&quot;.</span>

                    <span>This is fine. The fire took more than five hours to fully put out, according to Pemex. Pemex said no injuries were reported, and production from the project was not affected. PRODUCTION WAS NOT AFFECTED YOU GUYS!! THE LINE IS PLEASED!! Angel Carrizales, head of Mexico&#x27;s oil safety regulator ASEA, wrote on Twitter that the incident &quot;did not generate any spill.&quot; He did not explain what was burning on the water&#x27;s surface. &quot;The turbomachinery of Ku Maloob Zaap&#x27;s active production facilities were affected by an electrical storm and heavy rains,&quot; according to a Pemex incident report shared by one of Reuters&#x27; sources.</span>

your future self loves you. they will look through old photos of you with affection, not disgust, nor embarrassment. they wish they could tell you stories of your future, of how much you’ll change, of the people you’ll meet, of how you’ll eventually learn to accept yourself, then love yourself. they will read your diary entries and poems and favourite lyrics, heart aching, tears in their eyes. if only you knew… 
your future self loves you. if only they could show you. they are living proof. you’ll turn out okay after all. they wish they were there to console you, dance with you, and make you write it a hundred times: “I AM LOVED”. they will listen to playlists you made, just to experience you again. they will write you a letter - of forgiveness, longing, reassurance. you will never read it. but you will know.</span>

THE HANDS OF THE EMPEROR by Victoria Goddard!!!! Please read this book, it is my new FAVORITE book, it is the best thing in the entire world and it has literally changed my life. 
It’s The Goblin Emperor (fealty, ethics, loyalty, the joy of serving a worthy and honorable lord), meets The West Wing (liberal politics, conversations in hallways, the long slow process of making the world better by increments, “Do you have a best friend? Is he smarter than you? Do  you trust him with your life? That’s your chief of staff.”), meets Moana (leaving home to follow the call of a powerful dream, returning home to bring back the dream and the fruits of your labor to your people, community and family, a solo journey across the sea mirrors an internal journey of personal identity).

Here’s the link to buy it on Amazon
And here’s the link to buy the hardback on Bookshop.org (Note: You will see the $42 price tag and wince, but I will point out that it is 900 pages long, which is really like three books, and $42 is not a bad price at all for three books. Just a factor to consider!)

Okay well, this is going VERY well, and we have a discord chat now. Here’s the link: https://discord.gg/NWSDsDMBMk (Link updated 6/29/21)</span>

                    <span>mateosfo: &quot;Wet bulb&quot; temperature is the temperature + relative humidity at which water stops evaporating off a &quot;wet&quot; thermometer bulb. If air is sufficiently humid (saturated w/ water vapor), evaporation will no longer cool the bulb, and it gets continuously hotter. [...] Dry air has essentially infinite capacity to absorb moisture, so, humans can survive in very high temps if the air is dry [...] But, the wet bulb is not about heat, per se. It&#x27;s about the absorptive capacity of air. A wet bulb temperature in the mid-80s F can, and does, kill humans. Heat waves in the EU &amp; Russia in 2003 and 2010 killed over a hundred thousand people at ~ 82 F. [...] If sweat won&#x27;t evaporate, our body temp rises, continuously.

                    <span>Introducing PathQuery, Google&#x27;s Graph Query Language
We introduce PathQuery, a graph query language developed to scale with Google&#x27;s query and data volumes as well as its internal developer community. PathQuery supports flexible and declarative semantics. We have found that this enables query developers to think in a naturally &quot;graphy&quot; design space and to avoid the additional cognitive effort of coordinating numerous joins and subqueries often required to express an equivalent query in a relational space. Despite its traversal-oriented syntactic style, PathQuery has a foundation on a custom variant of relational algebra -- the exposition of which we presently defer -- allowing for the application of both common and novel optimizations. We believe that PathQuery has withstood a &quot;test of time&quot; at Google, under both large scale and low latency requirements. We thus share herein a language design that admits a rigorous declarative semantics, has scaled well in practice, and provides a natural syntax for graph traversals while also admitting complex graph patterns.

Things that are somewhat interesting to me, from an engineering standpoint:
1. PathQuery has a module/compilation system, enabling re-use of PathQuery modules across projects.  (Someone had mentioned that Google has around 40,000 PathQuery modules already, internally...)
Also, from a socio-linguistic perspective, Graph Languages are effectively the new Object-Relational Mapping layer, but they solve an interesting organizational problem of allowing multiple teams to code in different languages, without needing to re-write / re-implement entities and mapping configurations in each language.  It&#x27;s the Old New Thing again...</span>

Somewhere in my notes in the last few days I saw someone add some tags that I’ve been thinking about ever since. I wish I could find them again (or that I’d just saved their post at the time) because I think they made a lot of sense. 
They were talking about how fanfic is becoming more and more mainstream while still remaining largely transgressive. It’s such an interesting dichotomy to think about!
On the one hand, you have sites like AO3 and realities like widespread high speed internet access being more and more accessible to larger and larger groups of people. This makes it incredibly easy for anyone at all to find and read fanfic. 
On the other hand, you have the roots of fanfic. It was b…</span>

A lot of people ask me what my biggest fear is, or what scares me most. And I know they expect an answer like heights, or closed spaces, or people dressed like animals, but how do I tell them that when I was 17 I took a class called Relationships For Life and I learned that most people fall out of love for the same reasons they fell in it. That their lover’s once endearing stubbornness has now become refusal to compromise and their one track mind is now immaturity and their bad habits that you once adored is now money down the drain. Their spontaneity becomes reckless and irresponsible and their feet up on your dash is no longer sexy, just another distraction in your busy life.

                    <span>&quot;Wilma! Where&#x27;d you put my electric drill!&quot; DentalSlim Diet Control is an intra-oral device fitted by a dental professional to the upper and lower back teeth. It uses magnetic devices with unique custom-manufactured locking bolts. It allows the wearer to open their mouths only about 2mm, restricting them to a liquid diet, but it allows free speech and doesn&#x27;t restrict breathing. [...] The practice of surgically wiring people&#x27;s jaws shut became popular in the 1980s, but it came with risks; vomiting brought with it the risk of choking and after 9 to 12 months the patients developed gum disease. In some cases, there were continuing issues with restriction of jaw movement and some developed acute psychiatric conditions. [...] &quot;The beauty of it is that once patients are fitted with the device, after two or three weeks they can have the magnets disengaged. They could then have a period with a less restricted diet and then go back into treatment,&quot; he says. [...] Patients are given a tool to open the device in an emergency, but none of the study participants needed to use it. Can&#x27;t wait until these get 0wnz0red like the internet dick cage.</span>

wall-e watching the couple in hello, dolly! hold hands as they walk and the camera pans to its wide eyes, brightened by the television reflection. then wall-e opens its claws little by little to fit together, holding its own hand, the last living thing on earth. alone with no one else but itself. and wall-e looks back up at the screen to see if its doing it right. the scene is so heart wrenching i can literally feel the sobs i was suppressing at 11, fighting their way back up my throat right now.

 has the trade screen image I showed here, but also vertical bars and a floodgate with some flowing water.


As we started to think about labor and military stuff, it became natural to just put it all into an info screen with various tabs.  So far I&#x27;ve mostly finished up the coding on the creatures and tasks tabs, which cover the old &#x27;u&#x27;nit and &#x27;j&#x27;obs screens (aside from the manager, which is now its own tab).  The new creatures tab also covers the animals section of the old &#x27;z&#x27; status screens, and the main unit list also has a stress readout so you can easily figure out who is having trouble.


Late last April, Zach and Annie also welcomed Princess Josephine of the Northern Lighthouse into their home!  Jojo is very small.  She is also fierce and ridiculous.</span>

SSI Restoration Act of 2021
i have never made a post like this before but i haven’t seen anyone here talk about it yet so i want to at least provide some links because this is extremely important for disabled people with or without benefits in the USA.

link to this tiktok 


she doesn’t name the bill in the video but in the comments it’s clarified that the act referred to is the SSI Restoration Act of 2021.
“The Supplementary Security Income (SSI) Restoration Act of 2021 has been introduced in both the House and the Senate. The bill would improve the lives of millions of SSI beneficiaries around the country, including over 2 million older adults who are living below the federal poverty level due to inadequate benefit levels, and often lose or are denied benefits due to outdated…</span>

                    <span>When everybody gets to be a princess: Located approximately halfway between Istanbul and Ankara, the empty town consists of hundreds of almost identical castles in various states of completion. Developers meant for these uniform villas to be luxury vacation homes for wealthy tourists when they began construction in 2014. However, when the company went bankrupt in 2018, investors pulled out of the deal which put construction on hold. The development cost a cool $200 million to build thus far. But instead of a grandiose, multi-million dollar retreat, Burj al Babas has become something out of a dystopian novel. [...] &quot;We only need to sell 100 villas to pay off our debt,&quot; said Mezher Yerdelen, deputy chair of the Sarot Property Group. &quot;I believe we can get over this crisis in four to five months and partially inaugurate the project in 2019.&quot;</span>

Similarly, the thieves are also able to sell off the product to retailers, who are none the wiser about who is actually receiving the money.

                    <span>Our opening weekend was amazing! All of the events were really fun, and packed. It&#x27;s nice to be back. The thing that struck me most about our Friday night re-opening party, Turbo Drive, was that it wasn&#x27;t the usual Turbo Drive crowd. I got the impression that a lot of people said to themselves, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what synthwave is, but I&#x27;m going anyway.&quot; And they stuck around, too! Also they all dressed up, but everyone dressed up for a different party. Here&#x27;s a girl dressed for the symphony, here&#x27;s a guy dressed for a punk show in 1977, here&#x27;s Lara Croft swing dancing with Snake Plissken. I very much hope that this wasn&#x27;t a one-off and that people hold on to that attitude: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what this is, but let&#x27;s check it out anyway&quot;. Nature is healing and you are allowed to try new things. Then Saturday, we had three events: the early show was Hubba Hubba Revue, followed by Bootie in the main room and Lower Underground in Above DNA. The audiences for these parties were more traditional; it was the usual Hubba, Bootie and dubstep/rave crowds, but, there were nearly twice as many of them as in the Before Times, which was awesome. I had wondered whether people would stil be skittish about being in crowds, and the answer to that is, NOPE. They were happy being absolutely packed in, sweating all over each other. Though all our staff are still wearing masks, I&#x27;d say that less than 1% of the customers were. No soft re-entry here: they have embraced the Full Florida. I also very much expected to see some people getting seriously sloppy by about 1am, since everyone is out of practice at drinking in public, but nope again: they mostly held their shit together pretty well! Good form, SF. Our crew were all pretty exhausted by the end. It&#x27;s going to take a little while to get our sea legs back. And also we are still hiring -- bartenders, security, restaurant and floor. Email jobs@dnalounge.com. Tonight: The Return of Death Guild! Bereft (I am reliably informed) in deathly bloom.</span>

“However, RFC 5280 defines the validity period of a certificate as

timestamps, inclusive. This inclusivity means that Let’s Encrypt’s

                    <span>Dear Lazyweb, As I&#x27;ve got a stack of otherwise-useless old iPads lying around, I&#x27;d like to use them for signage: load a web page playing an MP4, don&#x27;t let the user click on anything. &quot;Guided Access&quot; sounds like it is made for this, but I keep coming back a day or two later and the screen is blanked. It&#x27;s on wall power and battery is at 100%. Any ideas? Also you can&#x27;t hide the Safari title bar, which is slightly annoying. There are a ton of &quot;digital signage&quot; apps out there on the app store, but that&#x27;s a spam-heavy SEO-poisoned concept to search for so I can&#x27;t tell if any of them actually do anything that I care about that &quot;Safari displaying a web page&quot; doesn&#x27;t already do.</span>

honestly that “it costs 0 dollars to be kind” bullshit is bullshit. it does cost things to be kind. it costs time. it costs energy. and it isn’t always easy and it isn’t always natural. it costs so much to be kind, sometimes. but that’s the whole point. if being kind were easy, or simple, every single person would be an angel. but they’re not, and the world isn’t easy and simple. so no, it does cost something to be kind. but it’s worth it anyway.</span>

                    <span>(Toady One) Here&#x27;s 
	
		the last Steam News, concerning beekeeping
	
, from earlier this month.


Since then, I&#x27;ve mostly been working on the trade screen.  It&#x27;s basically at a good spot now, though there are various bits that could be added, probably most notably the ability to view items again (it&#x27;s not compatible with how we have our item sheets set up now, but I can work through it), and a few new lines of text to make the hidden haggling mechanics a little more sensible (to new players, counter-offers feel like they trigger at random, but it&#x27;s actually based on skill rolls vs. profit/mood, etc.)  Also notably, there are item string filters now.  The little merchant in the top left is so low because creatures can be 64 pixels tall now, and dwarves can even be taller than 32 pixels if they have the right hair style, I think, but I&#x27;ll probably adjust the positioning for smaller creatures before the end.  These sorts of things add up to make each of these screen rewrites take longer than expected, but another one down brings us that much closer.


Next up we&#x27;ll probably be looking at finishing the labor rewrite, the workshop profiles, and then how that all connects up e.g. to the military stuff (through e.g. civilian item assignments.)  That&#x27;s also bound to get a little messy, ha ha.</span>

the thing about self love is you are already doing everything in your day to day to allow yourself to love yourself. if someone else charged your phone, you would appreciate that gesture. if someone else bought or cooked you a meal, you would appreciate that gesture. if someone else did your laundry, you would appreciate that gesture. all of those things are already acts of love to yourself. you don’t have to do anything more to be able to love yourself, you just have to reframe how you think about what you are already doing.</span>

love looks like the mosaic from ancient rome about a race horse that says: “win or lose, we love you, polidoxus”

love looks like all the people across history who have cared for their pets and named them sweet things like much-beloved or lovely or precious or grain-of-gold. and commissioned for their likenesses to be carved or painted or made into mosaics. bc their affection was so much greater and grander than the constraints of a human lifetime. and some piece of those pets outlasted even their owners in the annals of history. like that’s love</span>

                    <span>The ETA Aquariids were towards the end of their shower on May 27, while the Arietids were at their beginning, so it could have been from either. Both tend to be more visible before dawn. Given that the image was snapped at 11:07 pm local time, the former might be more likely than the latter. The Arietids is one of the most intense meteoroids streams with up to 60 shooting stars an hour but most of them streak through the sky during the daytime so we don&#x27;t see them.</span>

                    <span>Not even Catwoman pussy. &quot;In the third season of &#x27;Harley Quinn&#x27; we had a moment where Batman was going down on Catwoman. And DC was like, &#x27;You can&#x27;t do that. You absolutely cannot do that.&#x27; They&#x27;re like, &#x27;Heroes don&#x27;t do that.&#x27; So, we said, &#x27;Are you saying heroes are just selfish lovers?&#x27; They were like, &#x27;No, it&#x27;s that we sell consumer toys for heroes. It&#x27;s hard to sell a toy if Batman is also going down on someone.&#x27;&quot; The duo compares the series to &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; -- &quot;if Mary killed a bunch of people&quot;.</span>

                    <span>Aaaaahhhhhh it&#x27;s almost time!! Thanks to another extremely generous donor, we were able to re-surface the main stage, in the same manner as the dance floor! For the first time in the stage&#x27;s 32 year life, it is actuallly level, and that weird bump in the middle (from a solitary glass block that used to poke through) is gone. Last year I put out a call for people who wanted to paint murals on some of our blank walls, but nothing really came of that, so last week I painted some chevrons on the balcony: I&#x27;d still like to get something painted on the walls inside the DNA Pizza and Above DNA restrooms, if only to cut down on the tagging. If you want to volunteer, let us know! Oh yeah, and since I mentioned last week that we could maybe give some old chandeliers a good home, three have shown up …</span>

Meeting friends is so much harder than people think. Like actually finding a group of people who you can genuinely vibe with and who you can trust is a hard process that can take years on top of years. Making fun of people who may have a harder time meeting friends is whack, it’s really not something that happens overnight.</span>

You then told us that, coincidentally, you owned the river, and our parents should have gotten us the same if we wanted fish. You gave a man a fish to murder us if we step too close to the river, or speak too loud, or eat a fish from another river. You’ve copyrighted the fishing net. It costs us fish to leave.</span>

                    <span>&quot;Ultimate Slip &#x27;N Slide&quot; Production Shut Down Over Explosive Diarrhea. The upcoming TV competition series has shut down indefinitely after up to 40 crew members fell violently ill during production on a remote ranch in Simi Valley, California. The outbreak of &quot;awful explosive diarrhea&quot; left people &quot;collapsing&quot; on set and &quot;being forced to run into port-o-potties.&quot; [...] According to an insider, many original crew members are reluctant to return to the shoot and blame the production for not ensuring that fresh, clean water was used on set. Plus side, maybe Ow My Balls will get picked up for a full season.</span>

                    <span>I always enjoy it when people tell on themselves with their font changes, making it clear that they have sent a hastily-edited form letter rather than a sincere one-to-one communication. Here&#x27;s what a recent email looked like when viewed in Mail on iOS: And here&#x27;s what it looked like in Mail on macOS. The difference is more subtle, but the text of [MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA] is still smaller (capital letters are 25px instead of 28px). Also one of them is Arial and the other is Helvetica. Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking -- normally when someone makes that distinction you know that you&#x27;re dealing with some kind of font-hipster super-nerd. This is true. But when they&#x27;re side by side, sometimes even normal people can tell them apart! Here&#x27;s an easy way to screw up like this on macOS: Compose an…</span>

                    <span>cheeseanonioncrisps:

Fact 1: ‘Rubber duck debugging’ is a programming technique whereby a programmer explains their code, line by line, to a rubber duck. The idea is that in explaining it they will eventually figure out what the problem is.
Fact 2: In the same way, a lot of ordinary non-programming problems can be solved by talking them over with a friend, even if said friend does not actually know that much about the topic/situation and can’t contribute much to the conversation.
Fact 3: When you thank said friend for helping you solve your problem, and they reply “I didn’t really say anything”, it is very inadvisable to take the opportunity to tell them about Fact 1. No matter how interesting a comparison it may seem at the time.</span>

                    <span>XScreenSaver 6.01 is out now. This is an X11-only maintenance release, so there are no macOS, iOS or Android packages this time around. The 6.00 refactor of the X11 XScreenSaver daemon has so far proven to be very stable and secure! The bugs fixed in this release are relatively minor. However: If you are using 6.00, I strongly recommend upgrading to 6.01. If you are using 5.xx, I strongly, strongly recommend upgrading to 6.01. Sadly, due to recent catastrophic decision-making on the part of certain Linux distros, I was forced to add the following section to the XScreenSaver manual: THE WAYLAND PROBLEM Wayland is a completely different window system that is intended to replace X11. After 13+ years of trying, some Linux distros have finally begun enabling it by default. Most deployments of it also include XWayland, which is a compatibility layer that allows some X11 programs to continue to work within a Wayland environment. Unfortunately, XScreenSaver is not one of those programs. If your system is running XWayland, XScreenSaver will malfunction in two ways: It will be unable to detect user activity in non-X11 programs. This means that while a native Wayland program is selected, XScreenSaver will think that you are idle, and may blank the screen prematurely. It will be unable to lock the screen. This is because X11 grabs don&#x27;t work properly under XWayland, so there is no way for XScreenSaver to prevent the user from switching away from the screen locker to another application. If you are aware of some way for XScreenSaver to reliably detect user activity under Wayland, do let me know. Maybe there is some dbus/systemd signal that I have missed? Now that the XScreenSaver 6.x daemon has been sandboxed and massively reduced in size, it might be plausible for someone to rewrite xscreensaver.c to speak Wayland instead of X11, to run inside the Wayland compositor, and then to launch the X11 programs xscreensaver-auth and xscreensaver-gfx as needed. But that someone will not be me.</span>

by Peter H. Hochschild, Paul Turner, Jeffrey C. Mogul,
Rama Govindaraju, Parthasarathy Ranganathan, David E. Culler, and Amin Vahdat.
“As fabrication pushes towards smaller feature sizes and more
elaborate computational structures, and as increasingly specialized
instruction-silicon pairings are introduced to improve performance, we
have observed ephemeral computational errors that were not detected
during manufacturing tests. These defects cannot always be mitigated
by techniques such as microcode updates, and may be correlated to
specific components within the processor, allowing small code changes
to effect large shifts in reliability. Worse, these failures are often
“silent” – the only symptom is an erroneous computation.”

                    <span>One of life&#x27;s simple joys is pointing a video camera at a TV. We should all do that more often. We recently got a screaming deal on this gargantuan 75&quot; TV, so we turned it into an instagram trap under the main stairs. I think it&#x27;s going to be very popular! &quot;What software does it use?&quot; None, it uses none software. Video feedback works better if it stays in the analog domain, as with 30+ year old camcorders and CRTs rather than that four letter word &quot;HDMI&quot;, but one does what one can. Hey, here&#x27;s an interior decoration project maybe one of you could help us out with. The Green Room, that room to the South of the Lounge that you enter from the stage-left stairs, has always been less inviting than we&#x27;d like. People treat it as more of a hallway than as a place to hang out. I think it could use a bunch of overstuffed thrift-shop couches and chairs -- really gaudy stuff -- and also a shitload of chandeliers. It has a surprisingly high ceiling, and I think that filling that space with dozens of chandeliers might look pretty cool. So, if you are a person who already has the hobby of frequenting thrift shops and estate sales, I&#x27;d love to give you a small monthly budget for broken down chandeliers and couches to dress up that room. (The couches, I assume, won&#x27;t long survive contact with the enemy and will need to be periodically replenished.)</span>
