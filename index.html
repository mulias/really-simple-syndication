                <p>Governor Newsom says that on June 15th California will be doing The Full Florida. Obviously a lot can happen in 54 days, and for all we know the whole state might shut down again instead, but since there's a chance that we're going to be allowed to operate at a normal capacity by mid-June, we have to start making plans... and by plans I mean "spending money". As such, we're looking for a Bar Manager! Is that you? Here's our job posting. Bar Manager Job Description: The historic DNA Lounge is currently seeki…</p>

                <p>An immense coal mine in Xinjiang flooded and shut down over the weekend of April 17-18. The blackout halted no less than one-third of all of Bitcoin's global computing power. The Xinjiang accident highlights that Bitcoin is a creature of fossil fuels -- principally coal, the dirtiest of them all. Overall, de Vries reckons that fossil fuels power around 70% of all Bitcoin mines worldwide, and that coal provides the vast majority of that share.

Now it opens a Finder window displaying a folder called "WebKitDropDestination-8FCUXgO8" with a .webloc file in it. Convenient. This started a couple of months ago. Is there some way I can make it stop doing this? Dragging from an HREF still works properly, it seems to be only the URL bar that has developed this new craziness.

I just think we shouldn’t hurt people on purpose and every single day I grapple with how upsetting and angering that idea is to people. 



People will say things like “if you think we shouldn’t hurt people on purpose that’s disrespectful and deliberately callous toward those who have been hurt on purpose already” and I have yet to find language to express the magnitude of how much that’s not true. We shouldn’t hurt people on purpose. Punishment is nothing. Cruelty is just cruel…</p>

One of the most fundamental human qualities seems to be the need to decorate things. 
The other day I was driving through some neighborhoods and was noticing that every single house and yard was adorned with wreaths, flags, statues, flowers, pretty stones, little lanterns, little windmills, wind chimes, and so on…
We decorate our laptops with stickers, our desks with knickknacks, our walls with pictures, ourselves with clothing and jewelry

                <p>Bill Gates now owns almost 242,000 acres of the continguous USA. This map shows that area as a rectangle that can be dragged. Lots of articles on this are full of "4D chess" speculations about climate change blah blah, but the real reason for this seems to be very simple: "just to collect rent." Most of us imagine farmers tilling the soil that has been in their families for generations. But many farmers lease at least some of the land they cultivate.

                <p>Dear Lazyweb, there seem to be two different Google Pay APIs. Which should I use? PaymentsClient seems to describe a Google-specific API, and PaymentRequest seems to describe a W3C API that Google plugs in to. Also, does Google Pay work in desktop macOS Chrome, if you do not own a physical Android device? What about in desktop Safari?</p>

                <p>I arrived at the club on Wednesday afternoon and one of our bike racks was missing -- torn out of the concrete at the root -- and two others were bent and wobbly. Also, our parklet was dented and had been moved a few inches. Some neighbors tell us that around 2AM, a bus took out a traffic light, a bolted-down city trash can, the bike racks, and then crashed into our parklet. I haven't heard any more details about that yet. Then this afternoon, Devon rolled up the garage door to discover a bunch of paramedic…</p>
