wall-e watching the couple in hello, dolly! hold hands as they walk and the camera pans to its wide eyes, brightened by the television reflection. then wall-e opens its claws little by little to fit together, holding its own hand, the last living thing on earth. alone with no one else but itself. and wall-e looks back up at the screen to see if its doing it right. the scene is so heart wrenching i can literally feel the sobs i was suppressing at 11, fighting their way back up my throat right now.

 has the trade screen image I showed here, but also vertical bars and a floodgate with some flowing water.


As we started to think about labor and military stuff, it became natural to just put it all into an info screen with various tabs.  So far I&#x27;ve mostly finished up the coding on the creatures and tasks tabs, which cover the old &#x27;u&#x27;nit and &#x27;j&#x27;obs screens (aside from the manager, which is now its own tab).  The new creatures tab also covers the animals section of the old &#x27;z&#x27; status screens, and the main unit list also has a stress readout so you can easily figure out who is having trouble.


Late last April, Zach and Annie also welcomed Princess Josephine of the Northern Lighthouse into their home!  Jojo is very small.  She is also fierce and ridiculous.</span>

i have never made a post like this before but i haven’t seen anyone here talk about it yet so i want to at least provide some links because this is extremely important for disabled people with or without benefits in the USA.

link to this tiktok 


she doesn’t name the bill in the video but in the comments it’s clarified that the act referred to is the SSI Restoration Act of 2021.
“The Supplementary Security Income (SSI) Restoration Act of 2021 has been introduced in both the House and the Senate. The bill would improve the lives of millions of SSI beneficiaries around the country, including over 2 million older adults who are living below the federal poverty level due to inadequate benefit levels, and often lose or are denied benefits due to outdated…</span>

                    <span>When everybody gets to be a princess: Located approximately halfway between Istanbul and Ankara, the empty town consists of hundreds of almost identical castles in various states of completion. Developers meant for these uniform villas to be luxury vacation homes for wealthy tourists when they began construction in 2014. However, when the company went bankrupt in 2018, investors pulled out of the deal which put construction on hold. The development cost a cool $200 million to build thus far. But instead of a grandiose, multi-million dollar retreat, Burj al Babas has become something out of a dystopian novel. [...] &quot;We only need to sell 100 villas to pay off our debt,&quot; said Mezher Yerdelen, deputy chair of the Sarot Property Group. &quot;I believe we can get over this crisis in four to five months and partially inaugurate the project in 2019.&quot;</span>

                    <span>California man stole 42,000 pounds of pistachios: Nuts are an ideal high-priced items to steal and resell because unlike electronic devices, pistachios don&#x27;t have serial numbers -- making them virtually untraceable. [...] Thieves have used forged documents, fake companies and computer hacking to pose as legitimate truckers. Similarly, the thieves are also able to sell off the product to retailers, who are none the wiser about who is actually receiving the money. [...] When detectives inspected the truck, they found the pistachios siphoned into 2,000-pound sacks -- making it easier for resale, police said.

                    <span>Our opening weekend was amazing! All of the events were really fun, and packed. It&#x27;s nice to be back. The thing that struck me most about our Friday night re-opening party, Turbo Drive, was that it wasn&#x27;t the usual Turbo Drive crowd. I got the impression that a lot of people said to themselves, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what synthwave is, but I&#x27;m going anyway.&quot; And they stuck around, too! Also they all dressed up, but everyone dressed up for a different party. Here&#x27;s a girl dressed for the symphony, here&#x27;s a guy dressed for a punk show in 1977, here&#x27;s Lara Croft swing dancing with Snake Plissken. I very much hope that this wasn&#x27;t a one-off and that people hold on to that attitude: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what this is, but let&#x27;s check it out anyway&quot;. Nature is healing and you are allowed to try new things. Then Saturday, we had three events: the early show was Hubba Hubba Revue, followed by Bootie in the main room and Lower Underground in Above DNA. The audiences for these parties were more traditional; it was the usual Hubba, Bootie and dubstep/rave crowds, but, there were nearly twice as many of them as in the Before Times, which was awesome. I had wondered whether people would stil be skittish about being in crowds, and the answer to that is, NOPE. They were happy being absolutely packed in, sweating all over each other. Though all our staff are still wearing masks, I&#x27;d say that less than 1% of the customers were. No soft re-entry here: they have embraced the Full Florida. I also very much expected to see some people getting seriously sloppy by about 1am, since everyone is out of practice at drinking in public, but nope again: they mostly held their shit together pretty well! Good form, SF. Our crew were all pretty exhausted by the end. It&#x27;s going to take a little while to get our sea legs back. And also we are still hiring -- bartenders, security, restaurant and floor. Email jobs@dnalounge.com. Tonight: The Return of Death Guild! Bereft (I am reliably informed) in deathly bloom.</span>

“However, RFC 5280 defines the validity period of a certificate as
being the duration between the “not before” and the “not after”
timestamps, inclusive. This inclusivity means that Let’s Encrypt’s
certificates have all been actually valid for 90 days plus 1 second.”

                    <span>Dear Lazyweb, As I&#x27;ve got a stack of otherwise-useless old iPads lying around, I&#x27;d like to use them for signage: load a web page playing an MP4, don&#x27;t let the user click on anything. &quot;Guided Access&quot; sounds like it is made for this, but I keep coming back a day or two later and the screen is blanked. It&#x27;s on wall power and battery is at 100%. Any ideas? Also you can&#x27;t hide the Safari title bar, which is slightly annoying. There are a ton of &quot;digital signage&quot; apps out there on the app store, but that&#x27;s a spam-heavy SEO-poisoned concept to search for so I can&#x27;t tell if any of them actually do anything that I care about that &quot;Safari displaying a web page&quot; doesn&#x27;t already do.</span>

honestly that “it costs 0 dollars to be kind” bullshit is bullshit. it does cost things to be kind. it costs time. it costs energy. and it isn’t always easy and it isn’t always natural. it costs so much to be kind, sometimes. but that’s the whole point. if being kind were easy, or simple, every single person would be an angel. but they’re not, and the world isn’t easy and simple. so no, it does cost something to be kind. but it’s worth it anyway.</span>

                    <span>(Toady One) Here&#x27;s 
	
		the last Steam News, concerning beekeeping
	
, from earlier this month.


Since then, I&#x27;ve mostly been working on the trade screen.  It&#x27;s basically at a good spot now, though there are various bits that could be added, probably most notably the ability to view items again (it&#x27;s not compatible with how we have our item sheets set up now, but I can work through it), and a few new lines of text to make the hidden haggling mechanics a little more sensible (to new players, counter-offers feel like they trigger at random, but it&#x27;s actually based on skill rolls vs. profit/mood, etc.)  Also notably, there are item string filters now.  The little merchant in the top left is so low because creatures can be 64 pixels tall now, and dwarves can even be taller than 32 pixels if they have the right hair style, I think, but I&#x27;ll probably adjust the positioning for smaller creatures before the end.  These sorts of things add up to make each of these screen rewrites take longer than expected, but another one down brings us that much closer.


Next up we&#x27;ll probably be looking at finishing the labor rewrite, the workshop profiles, and then how that all connects up e.g. to the military stuff (through e.g. civilian item assignments.)  That&#x27;s also bound to get a little messy, ha ha.</span>

the thing about self love is you are already doing everything in your day to day to allow yourself to love yourself. if someone else charged your phone, you would appreciate that gesture. if someone else bought or cooked you a meal, you would appreciate that gesture. if someone else did your laundry, you would appreciate that gesture. all of those things are already acts of love to yourself. you don’t have to do anything more to be able to love yourself, you just have to reframe how you think about what you are already doing.</span>

love looks like the mosaic from ancient rome about a race horse that says: “win or lose, we love you, polidoxus”

love looks like all the people across history who have cared for their pets and named them sweet things like much-beloved or lovely or precious or grain-of-gold. and commissioned for their likenesses to be carved or painted or made into mosaics. bc their affection was so much greater and grander than the constraints of a human lifetime. and some piece of those pets outlasted even their owners in the annals of history. like that’s love</span>

                    <span>The ETA Aquariids were towards the end of their shower on May 27, while the Arietids were at their beginning, so it could have been from either. Both tend to be more visible before dawn. Given that the image was snapped at 11:07 pm local time, the former might be more likely than the latter. The Arietids is one of the most intense meteoroids streams with up to 60 shooting stars an hour but most of them streak through the sky during the daytime so we don&#x27;t see them.</span>

                    <span>Not even Catwoman pussy. &quot;In the third season of &#x27;Harley Quinn&#x27; we had a moment where Batman was going down on Catwoman. And DC was like, &#x27;You can&#x27;t do that. You absolutely cannot do that.&#x27; They&#x27;re like, &#x27;Heroes don&#x27;t do that.&#x27; So, we said, &#x27;Are you saying heroes are just selfish lovers?&#x27; They were like, &#x27;No, it&#x27;s that we sell consumer toys for heroes. It&#x27;s hard to sell a toy if Batman is also going down on someone.&#x27;&quot; The duo compares the series to &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; -- &quot;if Mary killed a bunch of people&quot;.</span>

                    <span>Aaaaahhhhhh it&#x27;s almost time!! Thanks to another extremely generous donor, we were able to re-surface the main stage, in the same manner as the dance floor! For the first time in the stage&#x27;s 32 year life, it is actuallly level, and that weird bump in the middle (from a solitary glass block that used to poke through) is gone. Last year I put out a call for people who wanted to paint murals on some of our blank walls, but nothing really came of that, so last week I painted some chevrons on the balcony: I&#x27;d still like to get something painted on the walls inside the DNA Pizza and Above DNA restrooms, if only to cut down on the tagging. If you want to volunteer, let us know! Oh yeah, and since I mentioned last week that we could maybe give some old chandeliers a good home, three have shown up …</span>

Meeting friends is so much harder than people think. Like actually finding a group of people who you can genuinely vibe with and who you can trust is a hard process that can take years on top of years. Making fun of people who may have a harder time meeting friends is whack, it’s really not something that happens overnight.</span>

“If you give a man a fish, he will eat for a day; if you teach a man to fish, he will eat for a lifetime,” but you have done neither. You have stood before us and eaten fish after fish, and chided us for our greed as you have done so. You have cast aside their offal and simultaneously chided us for our waste. You then told us that, coincidentally, you owned the river, and our parents should have gotten us the same if we wanted fish. You gave a man a fish to murder us if we step too close to the river, or speak too loud, or eat a fish from another river. You’ve copyrighted the fishing net. It costs us fish to leave.</span>

                    <span>&quot;Ultimate Slip &#x27;N Slide&quot; Production Shut Down Over Explosive Diarrhea. The upcoming TV competition series has shut down indefinitely after up to 40 crew members fell violently ill during production on a remote ranch in Simi Valley, California. The outbreak of &quot;awful explosive diarrhea&quot; left people &quot;collapsing&quot; on set and &quot;being forced to run into port-o-potties.&quot; [...] According to an insider, many original crew members are reluctant to return to the shoot and blame the production for not ensuring that fresh, clean water was used on set. Plus side, maybe Ow My Balls will get picked up for a full season.</span>

                    <span>I always enjoy it when people tell on themselves with their font changes, making it clear that they have sent a hastily-edited form letter rather than a sincere one-to-one communication. Here&#x27;s what a recent email looked like when viewed in Mail on iOS: And here&#x27;s what it looked like in Mail on macOS. The difference is more subtle, but the text of [MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA] is still smaller (capital letters are 25px instead of 28px). Also one of them is Arial and the other is Helvetica. Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking -- normally when someone makes that distinction you know that you&#x27;re dealing with some kind of font-hipster super-nerd. This is true. But when they&#x27;re side by side, sometimes even normal people can tell them apart! Here&#x27;s an easy way to screw up like this on macOS: Compose an…</span>

i dont know why people are like ‘we need to bully people so they are more normal’ when if the internet has been anything its been a series of longitudinal studies showing that prolonged large scale bullying tends to lead people to becoming increasingly weird, paranoid, sometimes off-putting, traumatized, emotionally troubled, ethically disregulated, etc. even unethical modalities like behaviorism don’t focus exclusively or primarily on punishment. like people should literally just be honest and say they want more bullying because they like to do it and have fun hurting other people</span>

                    <span>cheeseanonioncrisps:

Fact 1: ‘Rubber duck debugging’ is a programming technique whereby a programmer explains their code, line by line, to a rubber duck. The idea is that in explaining it they will eventually figure out what the problem is.
Fact 2: In the same way, a lot of ordinary non-programming problems can be solved by talking them over with a friend, even if said friend does not actually know that much about the topic/situation and can’t contribute much to the conversation.
Fact 3: When you thank said friend for helping you solve your problem, and they reply “I didn’t really say anything”, it is very inadvisable to take the opportunity to tell them about Fact 1. No matter how interesting a comparison it may seem at the time.</span>

                    <span>XScreenSaver 6.01 is out now. This is an X11-only maintenance release, so there are no macOS, iOS or Android packages this time around. The 6.00 refactor of the X11 XScreenSaver daemon has so far proven to be very stable and secure! The bugs fixed in this release are relatively minor. However: If you are using 6.00, I strongly recommend upgrading to 6.01. If you are using 5.xx, I strongly, strongly recommend upgrading to 6.01. Sadly, due to recent catastrophic decision-making on the part of certain Linux distros, I was forced to add the following section to the XScreenSaver manual: THE WAYLAND PROBLEM Wayland is a completely different window system that is intended to replace X11. After 13+ years of trying, some Linux distros have finally begun enabling it by default. Most deployments of it also include XWayland, which is a compatibility layer that allows some X11 programs to continue to work within a Wayland environment. Unfortunately, XScreenSaver is not one of those programs. If your system is running XWayland, XScreenSaver will malfunction in two ways: It will be unable to detect user activity in non-X11 programs. This means that while a native Wayland program is selected, XScreenSaver will think that you are idle, and may blank the screen prematurely. It will be unable to lock the screen. This is because X11 grabs don&#x27;t work properly under XWayland, so there is no way for XScreenSaver to prevent the user from switching away from the screen locker to another application. If you are aware of some way for XScreenSaver to reliably detect user activity under Wayland, do let me know. Maybe there is some dbus/systemd signal that I have missed? Now that the XScreenSaver 6.x daemon has been sandboxed and massively reduced in size, it might be plausible for someone to rewrite xscreensaver.c to speak Wayland instead of X11, to run inside the Wayland compositor, and then to launch the X11 programs xscreensaver-auth and xscreensaver-gfx as needed. But that someone will not be me.</span>

“As fabrication pushes towards smaller feature sizes and more
elaborate computational structures, and as increasingly specialized
instruction-silicon pairings are introduced to improve performance, we
have observed ephemeral computational errors that were not detected
during manufacturing tests. These defects cannot always be mitigated
by techniques such as microcode updates, and may be correlated to
specific components within the processor, allowing small code changes
to effect large shifts in reliability. Worse, these failures are often
“silent” – the only symptom is an erroneous computation.”

                    <span>One of life&#x27;s simple joys is pointing a video camera at a TV. We should all do that more often. We recently got a screaming deal on this gargantuan 75&quot; TV, so we turned it into an instagram trap under the main stairs. I think it&#x27;s going to be very popular! &quot;What software does it use?&quot; None, it uses none software. Video feedback works better if it stays in the analog domain, as with 30+ year old camcorders and CRTs rather than that four letter word &quot;HDMI&quot;, but one does what one can. Hey, here&#x27;s an interior decoration project maybe one of you could help us out with. The Green Room, that room to the South of the Lounge that you enter from the stage-left stairs, has always been less inviting than we&#x27;d like. People treat it as more of a hallway than as a place to hang out. I think it could use a bunch of overstuffed thrift-shop couches and chairs -- really gaudy stuff -- and also a shitload of chandeliers. It has a surprisingly high ceiling, and I think that filling that space with dozens of chandeliers might look pretty cool. So, if you are a person who already has the hobby of frequenting thrift shops and estate sales, I&#x27;d love to give you a small monthly budget for broken down chandeliers and couches to dress up that room. (The couches, I assume, won&#x27;t long survive contact with the enemy and will need to be periodically replenished.)</span>

You shouldn’t be treating nb people like the secret sexy 3rd gender. Nb people don’t look like a mash of male and female, they’re not sexy androgynous twinks

white skinny androgynous nb people reblogging this and saying shit like “Well this is what I look like! So I feel represented!” Are literally part of the problem. I’m not saying that no nb people are white/skinny/andro, I’m saying that those are the only type of nb bodies that get represented 


its nice, isnt it, when nonbinary people are visibly distinct from binary people? its easy, isnt it? you can remember to use “they” for people who have no visible breasts or beards, right? no need to challenge the notion of male vs female if nonbinary people have their own look, isnt that right?
its time to step the fuck up and really understand that nonbinary looks like anybody. nonbinary looks like you. nonbinary looks like your family and friends and it looks like the strangers who you thoughtlessly call “he” or “she” because of their appearance.
really supporting nonbinary people means understanding that theres no visual tell - you wont recognise all of us as nonbinary on sight. you have to actually LISTEN to us. you have to BELIEVE us. and it means challenging your assumptions about gender, starting with the assumption that youre an ally to trans people while youre still doing puerile shit like gendering body parts and clothes.
NONBINARY LOOKS LIKE ANYBODY. ANY BODY CAN BE NONBINARY.</span>

Thematically speaking, the most important thing Terry Pratchett taught me was the concept of militant decency. The idea that you can look at the world and its flaws and its injustices and its cruelties and get deeply, intensely angry, and that you can turn that into energy for doing the right thing and making the world a better place. He taught me that the anger itself is not the part I should be fighting. Nobody in my life ever said that before.</span>

shoutout to everybody who cannot partake in the shared history spongebob memes give everyone because they were, for some inexplicable reason, never allowed to watch spongebob 

It’s weird because unlike most other experiences, this is not one you can go back and rectify. It’s already too late for me to grow up watching spongebob  

Few things in this world can be genuinely lost forever and I don’t know how to feel that this, of all things, is one of them 



I disliked Spongebob as a kid and decided on my own not to watch it. It kept preempting ATLA.</span>

stupid leftists and their belief in *checks notes* the intrinsic value of human life


Reblog if you would burn down the statue of liberty to save a life
Here’s the thing, though. If you asked a conservative “Would you let the statue of liberty burn to save one life?” they’d probably scoff and say no, it’s a national landmark, a treasure, a piece of too much historical importance to let it be destroyed for the sake of one measly life. 
But if you asked, “Would you let the statue of liberty burn in order to save your child? your spouse? someone you loved a great deal?” the tune abruptly changes. At…</span>

something about needless tragedy when its effectively written and how it works SO well. boromir taking like seven arrows to the chest and continuing to fight and it doesnt save merry and pippin. the fact that merry and pippin were needlessly taken bc the uruks thought they had the ring, which they didnt. there are people in this war willingly sacrificing themselves to distract sauron from frodo and then there are people given no time to think through a plan, doing the best with the few seconds they have and dying with the hope that their actions will protect the people they love. and sometimes it doesnt. boromirs epic final stand did not actually matter, did not give the hobbits a chance to escape. but his final breaths were given with love nonetheless.

sometimes heroism is not in whether or not your actions actually save people, sometimes the glory is simply in the desperate and heartfelt trying</span>

                    <span>We just picked up a 75&quot; TV for super cheap and we&#x27;re trying to figure out what to do with it. I was thinking maybe we&#x27;d set it up vertically (5&#x27;6&quot; tall!) and turn it into some kind of &quot;magic mirror&quot; where it does video effects on your reflection or something. Is there any good software out there for that? Any other suggestions? It&#x27;s very heavy, so using it as an on-stage prop would be a hassle; it needs to be mounted somewhere. We could just stick it in the DNA Pizza window and use it for signage, but that&#x27;s not very exciting.</span>
