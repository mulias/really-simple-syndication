Obviously a lot can happen in 54 days, and for all we know the whole state might shut down again instead, but since there's a chance that we're going to be allowed to operate at a normal capacity by mid-June, we have to start making plans... and by plans I mean "spending money".

                <p>A Field Guide To San Francisco's Iconic Street Signs: There have been roughly three eras of street signage in the city by the bay: the pre-automobile era, which featured a wildly inconsistent and much-complained-about mess through the 1800s and early 1900s. Then came a few decades of good standard blue porcelain signs (1920s to late 1940s). And finally the signature black-on-white that appeared in the 1940s and is still with us today.

I just think we shouldn’t hurt people on purpose and every single day I grapple with how upsetting and angering that idea is to people. 



People will say things like “if you think we shouldn’t hurt people on purpose that’s disrespectful and deliberately callous toward those who have been hurt on purpose already” and I have yet to find language to express the magnitude of how much that’s not true. We shouldn’t hurt people on purpose. Punishment is nothing. Cruelty is just cruel…</p>

One of the most fundamental human qualities seems to be the need to decorate things. 
The other day I was driving through some neighborhoods and was noticing that every single house and yard was adorned with wreaths, flags, statues, flowers, pretty stones, little lanterns, little windmills, wind chimes, and so on…
We decorate our laptops with stickers, our desks with knickknacks, our walls with pictures, ourselves with clothing and jewelry

                <p>Bill Gates now owns almost 242,000 acres of the continguous USA. This map shows that area as a rectangle that can be dragged. Lots of articles on this are full of "4D chess" speculations about climate change blah blah, but the real reason for this seems to be very simple: "just to collect rent." Most of us imagine farmers tilling the soil that has been in their families for generations. But many farmers lease at least some of the land they cultivate.

                <p>Every time we post to our Facebook account, it immediately gets 2-5 one-word comments from random Indian dudes with locked accounts that are years old and have thousands of friends: "How are you doing, fellow San Francisco nightclub enthusiasts?" This has increased dramatically in the last couple of months, so I guess we've attracted the attention of the Eye of Sauron of some botfarm. To report these spam comments is a tiny, totally tractable number of clicks. Barely any clicks at all. Hardly worth mentioni…</p>

                <p>Dear Lazyweb, there seem to be two different Google Pay APIs. Which should I use? PaymentsClient seems to describe a Google-specific API, and PaymentRequest seems to describe a W3C API that Google plugs in to. Also, does Google Pay work in desktop macOS Chrome, if you do not own a physical Android device? What about in desktop Safari?</p>

                <p>The new "Kung Fu" series is predictably terrible, though I am contractually obliged to watch anything set in San Francisco, especially if there is chop-socky involved. But the most distracting part is SF's alternate geography. First of all, her family owns a small, faltering dim sum restaurant in Chinatown (in a building that is 25'x100' at best, but still only has like 6 tables in it), but instead of living in Chinatown, they have a huge house in the chilly, pine-tree suburb of...

                <p>I arrived at the club on Wednesday afternoon and one of our bike racks was missing -- torn out of the concrete at the root -- and two others were bent and wobbly. Also, our parklet was dented and had been moved a few inches. Some neighbors tell us that around 2AM, a bus took out a traffic light, a bolted-down city trash can, the bike racks, and then crashed into our parklet. I haven't heard any more details about that yet. Then this afternoon, Devon rolled up the garage door to discover a bunch of paramedic…</p>
