                    <span>Here&#x27;s the worst part about switching to a new point-of-sale system: buying a whole stack of new iPads. And this is less than half of them. Because of course the perfectly functional iPads we already have are now unsuitable. These things would have been considered supercomputers in the 90s, but I&#x27;m to believe that they are so old and obsolete that they are incapable of keeping up with someone clicking the button that says &quot;cheese slice&quot;. A task like that obviously requires the absolute bleeding edge. Apple has stopped shipping OS updates for our existing iPads, and vendors don&#x27;t support old versions of iOS, largely because Apple intentionally makes it nearly impossible for them to do so even if they wanted to. The second worst part is that nobody offers data portability of any kind. If we …</span>

things i’ll call you a whore for:

stealing my food 
stealing my lemons
my cat likes you more than me

why are lemons separate from food op?

everyone knows lemons arent food

lemon stealing whores are a huge issue separate from food stealing whores. there’s a whole documentary about whores stealing lemons from the trees of unsuspecting victims. you can see the first two minutes of it here.



Thats a rickroll. That totally is a fucking rickroll. No fukin way. Not falling for it.

dude, trust me, that isn’t a rick roll. its something worse



Me to the rest of tumblr after actually watching what was in the link:

…I really don’t know what I was expecting.



What the fuck did i just watch.



It- it’s not a Rick  roll 



Have we really reached a time when the Lemon Stealing Whores are no longer common knowledge.</span>

                    <span>Here&#x27;s a final photo of our new dance floor, after being painted and before anyone has thrown up on it, or dragged a road case across it where half of the wheels have been replaced with jagged pieces of sheet metal: We re-surfaced the Above DNA stage. No more burlesque performers complaining about getting splinters in their butts! We replaced the floor in our walk-in fridge. Ten years of dragging beer kegs over it took quite a toll: And we built a new VIP booth. We&#x27;ve replaced the two upstairs 6-person booths with a single 9-person booth. It&#x27;s raised on a platform like downstairs, and has three benches and is a bit more enclosed than the others: Only 35 more days until we get to invite you back inside!</span>

                    <span>closet-keys:

It’s extremely weird how comfortable people are with violence if it wears a police uniform. Like someone who would be afraid to even raise their voice against a customer and would never dream of shoving someone in intimidation in any situation is somehow simultaneously okay with asking someone to go up and threaten them with a loaded gun and drag them out of the building. If cops weren’t normalized and it was just some random guy, they’d never do it. They wouldn’t turn to their coworker and say “that person’s breaking the store policy, can you take this loaded gun and chase him out of here?” I wish I could snap people out of this cognitive dissonance they have where violence doesn’t count if it comes with a badge.</span>

I want them to be okay with autistic people being fucking weird when that’s what we are! I don’t want you to suddenly dismiss our unique behaviours. I want you to be okay with the fact I go extended amounts of time without talking. I want you to be okay with the fact I move my arms in a weird way. I want you to be okay with the fact I will be in genuine pain if I hear that seemingly harmless noise just one more time. I want neurotypicals to be okay with the fact that sometimes, they WILL find autistic people wacky and that we STILL deserve respect regardless.</span>

From the logs they sent, it looks like the XInput2 extension still exists but has stopped working entirely. No events are printed by driver/test-xinput (with no args, or with -grab -kbd-async -mouse-async). Can anyone confirm or deny this?

                    <span>(Toady One) The second Covid shot.  Which is good, because that should convey a healthy chunk of anti-Covidness.

Still moving this month, and it&#x27;s going to keep slowing everything down to a crawl.  The lease on the old place lapses this month, so we&#x27;ll get through it one way or another!

ok but shonen rly did it with mob man. every protag is just some little boy but mob is the most boy ever and like it makes him so so incredible. like i have a soft spot for all of the sweet and pure protags like tanjiro and deku but like mob isn’t trying to be a superhero or save the world from evil he’s just trying to gain some muscle and talk to his crush and be a good big brother and yes i KNOW that’s the whole point of him and the show i just want to talk about him bc i love…</span>

                    <span>Jeff Bezos&#x27; superyacht is so big it needs its own yacht. The world&#x27;s richest man is buying a boat, though that word feels inappropriately sensible for the monstrosity going to Captain Bezos: a 417-foot superyacht that&#x27;s so massive it has its own &quot;support yacht&quot; with a helipad. The estimated cost, not including the boat&#x27;s support boat, is $500 million. Half a billion bucks is an inconceivable amount of money for most people, but it&#x27;s a small fraction of the $75 billion that Bezos gained in 2020 alone. His to…</span>

                    <span>I made a time-lapse video of the dance floor installation! This is the first two days of the floor installation. They also came back for a third full day of sanding, but that wasn&#x27;t very interesting to watch; and now we&#x27;re going to paint it, which will take another day or two. (We do have an older video where you can watch paint dry, if you&#x27;re in to that sort of thing.) We set up a laptop recording 24/7 all weekend with OBS, and that generated a 98 GB TS file.

                    <span>Thanks to three generous donors who prefer to remain anonymous, we have a new dance floor! And it looks fantastic. The existing floor was a festive pancake of concrete, then a quarter inch of neoprene for springiness, then two layers of plywood. After two decades of dancing, the old plywood was extremly torn up, meaning the surface was rough and splotchy and paint would no longer stick to it well. It was a finished surface but a soft wood, probably pine or Douglas fir. After repairing some soft spots in the…</span>

                    <span>We finally got our fan controllers replaced. And there was much rejoicing. We have two gigantic fans on the roof, and about a decade ago the controllers that let us operate them at variable speed broke. Those controllers were many thousands of dollars each, so we just tore them out and replaced them with a pair of on-off switches, meaning the fans were either on at 100%, or off. This kind of sucked (see what I did there). Well it turns out, the price of the controllers has dropped a lot since then, so we fi…</span>

                    <span>We had to replace our big CO2 tank. It had a slow leak, which was costing us money, and so we had been using smaller rental tanks instead of the big one for quite a while, which was also costing us more money. And Airgas had been pretty unreliable about those deliveries; it seems that the schedule that they are comfortable with is, &quot;we&#x27;ll probably fill up the big tank from the street on our own schedule sometime within a six week window&quot;. Anything other than that, and they could hardly be bothered. We often…</span>

                    <span>You can read more about it at the Google Open Source blog post, Logica: organizing your data queries, making them universally reusable and fun.
They advocate for datalog-like language they developed internally at Google.
